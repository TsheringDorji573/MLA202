Hi! This repository contains my solutions for the MLA202 Reinforcement Learning take-home practical. I have completed all three problems and organized the code for clarity.

Files included:

Requirements:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Libraries: numpy, matplotlib, torch, gymnasium

How to run:
1. Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed.
2. Install the required libraries using:
   pip install numpy matplotlib torch gymnasium
3. Open '03240424_practical_test.ipynb' in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code Jupyter extension.
4. Run all the cells from top to bottom to see the results and plots.
5. Everything should run smoothly as tested.

Thanks for checking my work!
